Preface
-------
This book outlines how we work.

If you find anything in need of an update, please don't hesitate to
suggest a change. Use the issues system in github, issue a pull-request,
or just simply send an email to Rickard with the suggested change.

Disclaimer: this is a multi-author best-effort to collect info potentially
useful for people working here. There are no *guarantees* that the supplied info
is correct. Note that this especially applies to information regarding contracts,
insurance, healthcare, and other info that could be, e.g., construed as legal advice. 
From our channels you will only ever be given informal advice in such matters. 
It is ultimately your responsibility to seek out, read and understand the actual rules, or
to hire legal expertise to help you with this.

Who and how to ask for help about formal matters
------------------------------------------------
When you arrive you should be assigned a 'supporting peer' ('fadder' in Swedish, also often referred to as 'mentor')
to show you around and introducing the department and the university. If you don't know where to turn for a
formal matter, this person is a good place to get started. Beyond that:

* If still unsure, ask the group secretary.
* About contracts, etc., contact the IFM 'HR-partner' (https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/ifm).
* Ask Rickard, preferably by email (try to avoid simply dropping by, unless urgent or of a more personal nature).
