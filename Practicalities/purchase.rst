'Mottagningsattest' in Raindance
--------------------------------
"Mottagningsattest" is an approval of receiving goods/trip/service according to order and should
be done by the person that has received the goods/trip/service to certify that the invoice is
correct to pay.

1. Click the box "Mottagningsattest" in the tab Coding.

2. If the invoice refers to a trip or conference fee e.g. you should write a message or purpose
   "in the pen" and as well the project number to be charged for the cost. Just click on the pen
   and you can write a message. This message will always follow the invoice and cannot be
   deleted.

3. Go to the tab Circulation. Overwrite the message at my row, write for example "OK /your
   name" and enter to confirm your text. Then it will show in my inbox that you are finished
   and I can proceed with account etc and send it on for approval and payment.

4. When you are finished click "Back". You will now come back to your inbox and the invoice
   will no longer appear in your inbox. Done!
