Receiving visitors
==================

For visitors staying a month or more there will be a bench fee.

1. You need a form that outlines (among other things) bench fees. Even for shorter visits this form is required. The form needs a signature from the department head. 
2. For international visitors you also need a copy of the passport.
3. Hand this form + passport to the IFM adminsitration.
4. Go to one of the places on campus that hands out employee/student cards. They take a photo and produces a card.
5. Take that card back to the IFM administration and ask to get a key and to get the door access you need.
