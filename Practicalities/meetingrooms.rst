Projector connections
---------------------

Seminar and lecture rooms with projectors should provide various adapters for connections. However, VGA
is not included. If you need a VGA adapter, there is one to borrow at IFM. You can find the adapter in 
the technical supplies room (M225) in Physics Building. To borrow, write your name on the list.
Remember to return the adapter as soon as you no longer need it, so it is available for others.
