When you are sick, let the head of department know as soon as possible, 
preferable by email, as well as anyone else affected by you being away.  

The below information should only apply to those formally hired by LiU. If you are on a scholarship,
you likely do not need to do anything (verify with your superior.)

Shorter than 8 days
+++++++++++++++++++
When you are back at work, register your sickdays in the primula HR system 
( https://hr.liu.se ). You do not need to report to 'Försäkringskassan'.

8 days or more, but not more than 14
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
From day 8 and forward you need a doctor's note. You get one from 'Vårdcentralen' 
( https://www.1177.se/Ostergotland/Hitta-vard/?q=V%C3%A5rdcentral&regions=5 ; book a meeting by calling.) 
As soon as you can from day 8 and forward, give the original doctor's note to the IFM 'HR-partner'
( https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/ifm ), who will inform your superior(s) and set up a plan for 
rehabilitation. When you are back, you should fill in a form 'Sjukföräkran - Försäkran i samband med sjukfrånvaro'
and hand it in the IFM's HR-partner. You do not need to register your sickdays in the 
web system.

15 days or more
+++++++++++++++
Follow instructions for 8 days or more above, at that point. From day 15 and forward 'Försäkringskassan' must
approve your sick days. However, the university will report your case to Försäkringskassan. (Check with IFM's
HR-partner exactly how this works and what is expected from you.)
