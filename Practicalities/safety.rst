Important telepone numbers and related info channels:

* 112 - emergencies: to get immediate emergency help, if someone in your vicinity has a serious accident or collapses, if you are subject to, or witnessing, a crime. You will be asked: what has happened? Where did it happen? What phone number are you calling from?
* 11414 - non-emergency police: Make non-urgent crime reports, etc. You can also do this online (e.g., bicycle theft.) For emergencies always use 112.
* 11313 - information service: Gives out information, e.g., about serious accidents or crisis situations pertaining to where you live, etc., e.g., large fires. Similar service online at: www.krisinfo.se . You should always use this rather than 112 'to get information about what is happening'.
* 116000 - missing children: Report missing children.
* 1177 - non-emergency healthcare info: Good help if you are unsure where to turn with a medical issue. Also good help available online at https://www.1177.se/ .For emergencies always use 112.
* Loud outside sound signal 'VMA': alternating 7 seconds noise, 14 seconds silence. This is used e.g., for gas leaks, large fires, or other major accidents(and also meant to be used in the event of war.) Note: this signal is tested at 3pm the first Monday that is not a holiday in March, June, September and December. A long signal of 30-40 seconds noise means the situation is over.
