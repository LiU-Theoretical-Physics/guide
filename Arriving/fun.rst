Alcohol
-------
Apart from licensed resturants and bars, stronger alcoholic drinks are sold exclusively by the Swedish `systembolaget <https://www.systembolaget.se/>`_. You need to be at least 20 years old to buy, and need to ID yourself for age if they ask. 
Ordinary stores can sell drinks up to 2.25 vol% alcohol without need for ID, and with ID, beer up to 3.5 vol% alcohol.
