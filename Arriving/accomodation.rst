Accomodation
============

* Register with `Victoria Park <http://www.victoriapark.se/>`, a company that provides non-furnished apartments. (Sadly the home page is only in Swedish, but use the provided google translate dropdown at the top.) When registering, make sure to enter that you are looking for an appartment to work at Linköping University. They may have available apartments on the homepage that you can apply for directly. No Swedish personal identity number is required just your date of birth. The 'arrival helper' or other people arranging your arrival may be able to further help you (e.g., for looking at the apartment), just ask.
* Once your work contract clears, you can be entered into Stångåstaden (stangastaden.se), which is the largest housing company in Linköping for rented properties. They base priority in assigning appartments on a 'point system', where each day in queue is one point. However, at the time of writing, moving to Linköping for work grants 600 points.
