Setting up at our department
============================

As you arrive you are supposed to be assigned a 'supporting peer'. If this has not happened, 
ask your host / supervisor-to-be about it. The supporting peer is supposed to be a person with
a similar type of employment as yourself, who has been at IFM long enough to know 
the routines, etc. 

The supporting peer should help you with:

* Show the new employee around the building, including:

  - Labs
  - Lunchroom, 
  - Places to "fika" (coffee, tea) etc. 
  - The different departments/units
  - Rest room ('vilorum')
  - Emergency care equipment
  - Fire equipment
  - How to escape the building.
  
* Make sure their computer account is setup ('Lukas' [still relevant?], email, file storage, IT-security)
* Retrive keys, id card, and show physical mailbox.
* Make sure internal webpages are updated with the new employee's name.  
* Inform about hours for lunch- and coffee breaks as well as meeting times 
  for the new employee's department and other meetings. 
* Introduce the new employee to his/her new colleagues.
* Be the closest contact person for the new employee with regards to 
  administrative and practical questions which may arise during the beginning of a new employment 
  as well as introduction to the social network at work. The need of guidance required may vary 
  depending on the new employee; a new employee who has been a student at LiU may not need
  guidance around LiU but may need to know hours for "fika". 
* Introduce the area of science as well as group members. 
* Introduce persons with key roles at IFM and explain 
  which person to contact when (more below).
* International employees and guests who will be staying at IFM for longer than one month will 
  be invited together with the supporting peer to a brief 'Welcome meeting' during the 
  new employee's start date. An email with information regarding date and time will be 
  sent to the new employee and the supporting peer. 
* Follow international guests and employees, 
  who will be staying for longer than one year at IFM, to the Migration Board, 
  the Tax office, the bank and other places where the new employee may need support. 
* Help the new employee find, read, and understand:

  - The information from LiU's salary department.
  - Rules/instructions in IFM’s Institution handbook on IFM's intranet.
  - Tules/instructions in the area of research manual at the area of research's home page.
  - Rules/instructions for employees regarding usage of computer-, network-, and system resources.
  
* Help the person send a presentation of/about themself to be published in IFM's Information 
  letter sent out every Wednesday.
