Setting up at our department
============================

As you arrive you are supposed to be assigned a 'supporting peer' to help you with setting up at the 
department. If this has not happened, ask your host / supervisor-to-be about it. The supporting peer 
is supposed to be a person with a similar type of employment as yourself, who has been at IFM long enough to know 
the routines, etc. 

Take help from the supporting to:

* Get introduced his your colleagues.
* Get to know the routines with respect to lunch- and coffee breaks as well as meeting times for recoccuring meetings.
* Find:

  - Labs
  - Lunchroom, 
  - Places to "fika" (coffee, tea) etc. 
  - The different departments/units
  - Rest room ('vilorum')
  - Emergency care equipment
  - Fire equipment
  - How to escape the building.
  - Key administrative people:
    * Head of department
    * Kanslichef
    * Personnel Administrator
    * Head of IT (not so relevant anymore, IT is centralized.)
    * Contact person for IT support
    * Responsible for officinalis
    * Goods reception/Porter’s office
    * Technical Supply service
    * Software/program licenses for computers
    * Environmental coordinator
    * Administrator


Things that needs to be done
----------------------------
* For international arrivals, find out what needs to be done, and do that, with regards to the Migration Board, 
  the Tax office, the bank and other places. Take help from your supporting peer in communicating with these.
* Receive a used, or order a new computer. This needs to be a Mac or Linux computer, even if you are more familar with
  Windows. Prior attempts at using Windows for what we do has led to issues. You should preferably get admin rights
  to your own computer.
* Get a central computer account ('Lukas' [still relevant?], email)
* Edit your profile and upload a profile picture on the central web page (https://minit.liu.se/). Make sure you appear
  on all other organizational web pages where you belong.

    *You can get help to take a picture in the photo studio in the IFM building.
    Ask your fadder for who is presently responsible for taking photos.*

* Retrive keys, id card, and find your physical mailbox.
* Attend the 'Welcome meeting' that you and your supporting peer will be invited to.
* Find, read, and understand:

  - The information from LiU's salary department.
  - Rules/instructions in IFM’s Institution handbook on IFM's intranet.
  - Rules/instructions in the area of research manual at the area of research's home page.
  - Rules/instructions for employees regarding usage of computer-, network-, and system resources.
  
* Write a presentation of/about yourself to be published in IFM's Information letter.
