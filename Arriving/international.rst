Help
----
When you set up your arrival, you should be directed to an *'arrival helper'* to help international researchers with arrival questions and their relocation such as accommodation, migration, insurance, tax, social security and day care/schooling for children. At the time of writing, this is a senior coordinator at the International office (https://liu.se/en/employee/jesgi11), 

Personal identification number
------------------------------
One of your priorities coming to Sweden should be to get a personal identification number ('personnummer' in Swedish). Many banks and services will require this.

Once you have a personnummer you may want to get a Swedish ID card, used for various needs to identify youself. 

Accomodation
------------
* Your first priority should be to contact the 'arrival helper' (see `Help`_)
* Register with `Victoria Park <http://www.victoriapark.se/>`, a company that provides non-furnished apartments. (Sadly the home page is only in Swedish, but use the provided google translate dropdown at the top.) When registering, make sure to enter that you are looking for an appartment to work at Linköping University. They may have available apartments on the homepage that you can apply for directly. No Swedish personal identity number is required just your date of birth. The 'arrival helper' or other people arranging your arrival may be able to further help you (e.g., for looking at the apartment), just ask.
* Once your work contract clears, you can be entered into Stångåstaden (stangastaden.se), which is the largest housing company in Linköping for rented properties. They base priority in assigning appartments on a 'point system', where each day in queue is one point. However, at the time of writing, moving to Linköping for work grants 600 points.
* More info is available in the separate `accomodation <accomodation.rst>`_ section of this guide (since it is relevant also for Swedes.)

Insurance
---------
At the time of writing, LiU has a group insurance that covers employees to/from work and during your time at work (accident, liability, illness etc.) [TODO: Does this apply also to those scholarships?] 

The insurance company `Länsförsäkringar <http://www.lansforsakringar.se/ostgota/om-oss/kontakta-oss/>`_ has an office in Linkoping. You are recommended to take out at least a house and contents insurance to cover personal belongings, this may even be required by your landlord. 

Other insurance companies are: `Folksam <https://www.folksam.se/kundservice/flera-satt-att-kontakta-oss/in-other-languages/english>`_, `Trygg Hansa <https://www.trygghansa.se/>`_, `IF <https://www.if.se/privat/kundservice/ovrigt/about-if-in-english>`_, `Skandia <https://www.skandia.se>`_.

Social security
---------------
If you are employed by LiU (as opposed to on a scholarship), you are covered by the Swedish Social security system `Försäkringskassan <http://forsakringskassan.se>`_. Coverage for loss of work due to illness is covered by LiU for the first 8 days, then försäkringskassan. The reimbursement is gradually reduced by the days. 

Healthcare
----------
Sweden have state 'single payer' healthcare. If you are have a taxed employment in Sweden with a personal identification number, you should be able to get the same coverage as Swedish citizens. However, the specific rules are somewhat complicated. The info at `1177 is a good start <https://www.1177.se/Ostergotland/Other-languages/New-in-Sweden---healthcare/Svenska/Regler-och-rattigheter/Vard-av-personer-fran-andra-lander/>`_.

When you arrive from EU, you are covered for acute helth needs if you have an "EU health card". It is important that you bring the EU cards with you to Sweden until you have entered the Swedish system.
